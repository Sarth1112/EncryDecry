This C++ application implements a file encryption and decryption system using the Caesar cipher algorithm. The program allows users to secure text files by shifting each alphabetic character a specified number of positions in the alphabet, while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. Users can input the source file, designate an output file, and specify a shift value (encryption key) between 1 and 25. The application provides options for both encryption and decryption, making it versatile for securing data and retrieving encrypted information.
The program demonstrates proficiency in file I/O operations, string manipulation, and basic cryptographic concepts. It employs modular design with separate functions for character-level encryption and decryption, as well as a main function to handle user interaction and file processing. Error handling is implemented to manage file access issues, and input validation ensures the shift value falls within the appropriate range. While the Caesar cipher is a simple encryption method primarily used for educational purposes, this project serves as a foundation for understanding more complex cryptographic systems and showcases skills in algorithm implementation and user interface design in C++.
